## 2. Governance Structure

### 2.1 Community Roles

- **OSF Users**: Individuals or organizations utilizing OSF for research and collaboration. Users provide feedback, report bugs, and suggest features through OSF Support, office hours, or interviews with the COS Product Team.
  - *General OSF Users*: Researchers, students, and institutions using OSF in their daily workflows.
  - *Power OSF Users*: Highly engaged users who provide in-depth feedback, beta test new features, and serve as informal ambassadors as OSF technology advocates.
  - *Institutional OSF Users*: Organizations and academic institutions integrating OSF into their research infrastructure and workflows. [Find out more about institutional partners on OSF](https://www.cos.io/institutions).

- **Contributors**: Individuals actively participating in OSF’s development, including code contributions, documentation, community engagement, and user support.
  - *Code Contributors*: Developers writing and reviewing code, fixing bugs, and developing new features.
  - *Documentation Contributors*: Individuals improving guides, FAQs, onboarding materials, and technical documentation.
  - *Community Advocates*: Members assisting new users, moderating discussions, and hosting community-driven events.
  - *Add-On Developers*: Contributors building integrations and extensions to enhance OSF’s functionality.

- **Maintainers**: Experienced contributors responsible for reviewing and merging contributions, managing releases, and guiding the project’s direction.

- **OSF Product Owners**: COS staff members overseeing the prioritization and implementation of community-submitted issues and feature requests.

- **Steering Committee**: The governing body responsible for providing recommendations to the COS product steering committee on OSF’s strategic direction, composed of senior maintainers, institutional representatives, and community leaders.

### 2.2 Selection and Role Transitions

- **Steering Committee Membership**: Members are nominated and selected through community consensus. Membership is reviewed annually, with opportunities for new voices to be included.
- **Decision-Making Process**: Decisions are made by consensus whenever possible. If consensus cannot be reached, a structured voting process is used, with each Steering Committee member having one vote.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Disputes should be resolved through respectful dialogue. If unresolved, they may be escalated to the Steering Committee for mediation, with impartial third-party input if necessary.
- **Stepping Down & Accountability**: Maintainers and Steering Committee members may step down voluntarily, with a transition plan in place to ensure continuity and knowledge transfer.

## 3. Reporting Inappropriate or Unwanted Behavior

### Reporting Process
- Issues of misconduct can be reported confidentially to the COS HR team (HR@cos.io) or designated community representatives.
- Reports should include relevant details and evidence where applicable.
- Communication channels for reporting include an online form, email, or direct outreach to community moderators.

### Review Process
- The HR team, in collaboration with an independent review panel, will assess reports in a timely manner.
- Investigations will be conducted impartially, with transparent outcomes where possible.
- Actions may include mediation, formal warnings, temporary suspensions, or removal from the community.

### Ensuring Accountability
- All community members, including COS leadership, are held to the same behavioral standards outlined in the Code of Conduct.
- Regular reviews of the Code of Conduct enforcement ensure fairness, effectiveness, and community trust.

## 4. Funding and Project Prioritization

### Community-Informed Prioritization
- The Steering Committee regularly reviews proposed projects and makes recommendations based on community needs and impact assessments.
- Feedback from contributors, institutional partners, and users is incorporated to ensure alignment with OSF’s mission and sustainability goals.

### Funding Allocation
- Funded projects may include core platform development, infrastructure improvements, integrations, community outreach initiatives, and research support.
- Transparency in funding decisions is maintained through public reporting and open discussions.

### Collaboration with COS Leadership
- The Steering Committee meets quarterly with COS leadership to discuss roadmaps, funding opportunities, and resource distribution.
- While COS leadership retains the final say on financial decisions, the committee provides strategic input and represents the voice of the community.

## 5. Communication Channels

- **Mailing Lists**: Official discussions, project updates, and governance notifications.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Platforms such as Discord (https://discord.gg/KDWasAks5y) for informal discussions, collaboration, and quick support.
  - *Note:* The COS team works 9 am to 5 pm ET on weekdays, but other community members may offer faster support.
- **Regular Office Hours**: COS team members will support weekly office hours to discuss the project, blockers, and project-specific topics.
- **Public Documentation**: A centralized repository of governance policies, GitHub, and community documentation is available.

## 6. Amendment Process

Governance policies should remain stable over time to maintain trust and continuity. However, when changes are necessary:

- Proposed amendments must be formally submitted to the Steering Committee for review.
- The community is given an opportunity to provide feedback through open discussions or surveys.
- Final approval of amendments follows a consensus-driven approach, with a formal vote if needed.

## 7. Community Resources and Funding

### Funding Sources
OSF may receive funding from grants, institutional partnerships, sponsorships, and community donations.

### Resource Allocation
- Funds support platform maintenance, feature development, infrastructure, community events, and documentation improvements.

### Project Roadmap/Management Chart
Ongoing projects, plans, and timelines will be documented and made publicly accessible to ensure visibility into development priorities.
