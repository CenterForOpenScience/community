## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Open Source Community and Tech Advocate Volunteer Group for the Open Science Framework (OSF)!

Our mission is to foster an open, inclusive, and collaborative environment where developers, researchers, and enthusiasts can contribute to the Open Science Framework (OSF) and related tools. Whether you're here to submit bug reports, propose new features, contribute code, or engage in discussions, your participation is valued.

By joining this community, you agree to abide by these guidelines to ensure a productive and respectful experience for all members.

## 2. Code of Conduct

We expect all members to interact respectfully and professionally. To foster a positive environment, we encourage the following behaviors:

### 2.1 Be Respectful
- Treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of experience, background, or opinions.
- Assume good intent but acknowledge that impact matters more than intent.
- Address disagreements constructivelyâ€”focus on ideas rather than individuals.

### 2.2 Be Collaborative
- Open source is built on teamwork. Engage with others to improve ideas and solutions.
- Help newcomers by sharing knowledge and offering guidance.
- Give credit where it's dueâ€”acknowledge contributions from others.

### 2.3 Be Transparent
- If youâ€™re working on a project or issue, communicate clearly and frequently.
- Use public channels for discussions rather than private messages to ensure transparency.
- Document your contributions and keep discussions open to all.

### 2.4 Be Inclusive
- Everyone is welcome, regardless of race, gender, age, disability, or background.
- Avoid language or behavior that is discriminatory, exclusionary, or otherwise harmful.
- Foster an environment where newcomers feel comfortable asking questions.

## 3. Moderation & Conflict Resolution

The COS community is moderated to maintain a positive and productive space. Moderators have the authority to address inappropriate behavior and enforce community standards.

### 3.1 Moderation Guidelines
Moderators are responsible for:
- Enforcing the Code of Conduct.
- Addressing reports of inappropriate behavior.
- Ensuring a welcoming and inclusive environment.

### 3.2 Reporting Issues
If you witness or experience behavior that violates these guidelines, please report it:
- Contact a moderator on Discord via `#moderation`.
- Open an issue in the Community Concerns category on GitHub (for non-private matters).
- If privacy is required, email the COS moderation team.

### 3.3 Conflict Resolution
If a disagreement arises:
- **Discuss respectfully** â€“ Resolve minor disputes directly with the involved parties.
- **Seek mediation** â€“ If unresolved, ask a moderator for assistance.
- **Escalation** â€“ If a resolution isnâ€™t reached, the COS team will step in to make a final decision.

### 3.4 Consequences for Violations
- **First offense:** A warning from a moderator.
- **Second offense:** Temporary suspension from the community.
- **Severe violations:** Permanent ban and removal from all related spaces.

## 4. Communication Channels

We use multiple platforms to facilitate collaboration:

### 4.1 GitHub

GitHub is our primary tool for managing open-source development.

- **Pull Requests (PRs)** â€“ Used for submitting contributions and reviewing changes.  
  Tag PRs accordingly (e.g., `bug fix`, `new feature`, `documentation update`).
- **Issues** â€“ Report bugs, propose features, and track progress.  
  Use labels like `bug`, `enhancement`, and `help wanted` to categorize issues.
- **Discussions** â€“ Engage in long-form discussions about projects.

### 4.2 Discord

We use Discord for real-time collaboration. Below are our key tags and their purposes:
