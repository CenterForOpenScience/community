# 👋 Welcome to the Center for Open Science GitHub

We’re so glad you’re here!

The **Center for Open Science (COS)** is a nonprofit organization dedicated to increasing openness, integrity, and reproducibility of research. Our flagship platform, the **[Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/)**, supports researchers across the full research lifecycle—from planning and preregistering studies, to sharing data, code, and preprints.

This GitHub space is home to the open-source development behind OSF and related tools. We welcome contributions and collaboration from researchers, developers, community builders, and anyone interested in open science.

🧪 What is the Open Science Framework (OSF)?

The [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io) is a free, open-source platform designed to help researchers plan, collaborate on, and share their research. It promotes open science by supporting transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration.

**Key features of OSF include:**
- **Project management & collaboration (OSF Projects)** – Organize research projects and manage contributors.
- **Archive of Registrations and Preregistrations (OSF registries)** – Create a timestamped read-only version of a research protocol to promote transparency in the research process.
- **Preprint hosting (OSF Preprints)** – Share preprints to get early feedback.
- **Open access & sharing** – Control who sees your data, code, and protocols.
- **Data storage & archiving** – Store and preserve research outputs.
- **Integrations** – Connect tools like Google Drive, Dropbox, GitHub, Mendeley, and so many more!.

### 🧰 What Are the OSF GitHub Repositories?

OSF is powered by several open-source repositories maintained here on GitHub. These services work together to deliver OSF's platform functionality:

- [`osf.io`](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/osf.io)[link coming soon] – The core backend platform (Python/Django)
- [`osf-angular`](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/osf-angular) [link coming soon]– The modern Angular-based frontend 
- [`waterbutler`](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/waterbutler) – Unified file storage and transfer API
- [`gravy-valet`](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/gravyvalet) – Add-on integrations and service coordination
