# The Open Science Framework (OSF) Ecosystem

The [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io) is a free, open-source platform maintained by the [Center for Open Science (COS)](https://www.cos.io) that supports researchers in managing, sharing, and preserving their work. OSF is built with several interconnected services that enable seamless collaboration, file management, and integrations with external tools.

## OSF Core Platform ([osf.io](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/osf.io))

The backbone of OSF, this repository manages study designs, datasets, manuscripts, and more. The backend is primarily built with Python using Django. It integrates PostgreSQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ for data management and task processing.

## OSF Frontend ([Angular-based Web Interface](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/osf-angular))

The current user interface for OSF is being transitioned from Ember.js to AngularJS to provide better performance, maintainability, and a more modular architecture. The frontend communicates with the OSF RESTful API to deliver a responsive and intuitive user experience.

## WaterButler ([File Management API](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/waterbutler))

A Python-based service that enables file storage interactions across various external services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) through a unified API.

## OSF Add-ons ([GravyValet](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/gravyvalet))

A microservice that manages integrations between OSF and external services like cloud storage and citation tools. It defines a shared API for enabling these features within OSF.

## How OSF Components Work Together

OSF‚Äôs architecture consists of multiple services that communicate through APIs to ensure smooth data management, file handling, and user interactions.

- **User Interactions** ‚Üí The user interface (`ember-osf-web` / `AngularJS`) communicates with OSF‚Äôs core backend via API calls.  
- **File Management** ‚Üí WaterButler enables file transfers by connecting OSF with external storage services.  
- **Add-ons & Integrations** ‚Üí GravyValet manages authentication and API calls for external services, working alongside WaterButler for file operations.  
- **Data Storage & Processing** ‚Üí The OSF Core Platform handles study data, metadata, and user-generated content with PostgreSQL and Redis.
