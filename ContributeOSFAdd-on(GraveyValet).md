# How to Contribute to an OSF Add-on (GraveyValet)

## Introduction

The Open Science Framework (OSF) supports a range of third-party services through add-ons, allowing researchers to seamlessly integrate external tools such as cloud storage, data repositories, and collaboration platforms into their workflows. By leveraging these integrations, researchers can improve data accessibility, maintain version control, and streamline collaboration within their projects.

## Understanding OSF Add-ons

An OSF add-on is an extension that facilitates the interaction between OSF and external services. Each add-on must adhere to OSF’s integration framework to ensure compatibility and security.

### Key Components

- **Interface System**: Defines the protocols for communication between OSF and add-ons.  
- **Implementation Module (Imp)**: Contains the logic required to interact with the third-party service.  
- **Authentication**: Uses secure protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0) to establish trusted connections.  
- **User Interface**: Provides OSF users with configuration and access options within the platform.

## Supported Add-ons

OSF currently supports various add-ons for cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox), repositories (e.g., GitHub), and data archiving (e.g., Dataverse). Researchers can enable or disable these integrations through their OSF settings.

## Contribution Process

### 1. Identify the Need

Before developing a new add-on, evaluate its necessity by:

- Assessing gaps in existing OSF functionality.  
- Gathering feedback from the OSF community.  
- Identifying widely-used research tools that could benefit from OSF integration.

### 2. Review Existing Implementations

To ensure consistency, study OSF’s current add-ons:

- Analyze authentication workflows and data retrieval methods.  
- Examine code structures and API interaction patterns.  
- Review community discussions and feature requests related to add-ons.

### 3. Set Up Development Environment

To begin development:

- Clone the OSF repository from GitHub.  
- Install required dependencies and libraries.  
- Set up a local testing environment to validate add-on functionality.

### 4. Develop the Add-on

- **Define Authentication**: Implement secure login mechanisms to authorize users.  
- **Integrate with API**: Ensure smooth data exchange between OSF and the external service.  
- **Create a User-Friendly UI**: Provide intuitive controls for enabling and managing the add-on.  
- **Implement Logging and Error Handling**: Ensure issues are logged for debugging and user support.

### 5. Submit for Review

Before submitting your add-on:

- Ensure adherence to OSF’s coding and security standards.  
- Provide detailed documentation, including setup instructions and use cases.  
- Submit a pull request for review, incorporating feedback from OSF maintainers.

## Technical Guide to Contributing OSF Add-ons

### Implementing an OSF Add-on

Each add-on must integrate with OSF’s standard interface to ensure consistency and reliability across services.

#### Required Methods

- `authenticate()`: Manages user authentication and token retrieval.  
- `fetch_data()`: Pulls data from the external service into OSF.  
- `push_data()`: Sends OSF data to the external service.  
- `disconnect()`: Handles revocation of access and cleanup processes.

### Writing an Imp (Implementation Module)

The Implementation Module (Imp) serves as the core of the add-on, defining its interaction with external services.

#### Key Considerations

- **API Integration**: Ensure compatibility with RESTful APIs or other service protocols.  
- **Security**: Utilize encrypted connections and follow best practices for data protection.  
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimize API calls and implement caching strategies to reduce load times.

### Testing Your Add-on

To ensure robust functionality:

- Conduct unit and integration tests covering key scenarios.  
- Validate authentication and authorization mechanisms.  
- Test error handling and recovery processes.

## Best Practices for OSF Add-ons

- Follow OSF’s coding and security guidelines.  
- Maintain comprehensive documentation for users and developers.  
- Engage with the OSF community for feedback and continuous improvement.  
- Provide real-world case examples demonstrating successful integrations.

By adhering to these principles, contributors can develop reliable and impactful add-ons, enhancing OSF’s capabilities and supporting open science initiatives.
